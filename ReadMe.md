Tensor networks for quantum simulations
=======================================

C code using CBLAS and LAPACKE; Mathematica reference implementation for testing.

Features:
- common operations on tensors of arbitrary dimension
- MPS and MPO structures
- built-in support for quantum numbers (U(1) symmetries)
- construction of common Hamiltonians (Ising, Heisenberg, Fermi-Hubbard, Bose-Hubbard) in 1D, by even-odd splitting or as MPO representation; MPO representation from arbitrary operator chain description
- imaginary and real-time evolution using even-odd splitting
- time-dynamical correlation functions and OTOCs at finite temperature
- one-site and two-site local energy minimization using Lanczos iteration
- preliminary support for PEPS

Directory structure:
- mathematica:  standalone Mathematica reference implementation, with the core routines in the `tn_base.m` package
- include, src: source code of the C implementation
- test:         unit tests for the C implementation, using the Mathematica version as reference
- doc:          documentation of the C code (generated by Doxygen)
- analysis:     simulation analysis notebooks, as illustration

The Mathematica notebooks can be opened by the free [CDF player](https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player).
