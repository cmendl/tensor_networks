Tensor networks for quantum simulations
=======================================

C code using CBLAS and LAPACKE; Mathematica simulation analysis notebooks as illustration and reference implementation for testing.


Features
--------
- common operations on tensors of arbitrary dimension
- MPS and MPO structures
- built-in support for quantum numbers (U(1) symmetries)
- construction of common Hamiltonians (Ising, Heisenberg, Fermi-Hubbard, Bose-Hubbard) in 1D, by even-odd splitting or as MPO representation; MPO representation from arbitrary operator chain description
- imaginary and real-time evolution using even-odd splitting
- time-dynamical correlation functions and OTOCs at finite temperature
- one-site and two-site local energy minimization using Lanczos iteration
- preliminary support for PEPS


Quickstart
----------
The code depends on the [CBLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/#_cblas) and [LAPACKE](http://netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html) libraries. These can be installed via `sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapacke-dev` (on Ubuntu Linux) or similar. Alternatively, the *Makefile* shows how to use the Intel compiler with MKL.

Call `make` to build the project. You might have to adapt some parameters in the *Makefile* beforehand (see the comments there).

The build process generates executable files in the *bin* subfolder for several types of Hamiltonians and simulation configurations (like computing dynamical correlations or OTOCs). This folder also contains example parameter files. To run the unit tests, cd into the *test* subfolder and call `./run_tests`.

The Mathematica notebooks can be opened by the free [CDF player](https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player).
